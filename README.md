Boom. I have officially taken the idea of Minecraft's command blocks to the next level in Factorio. 

I'd say this mod has nearly infinite potential. Practically anything is possible. It's just a matter of writing the modules for it, and adding it to the api now. 

And that's the hard part. I don't know what's possible since I'm the only current user, and that's why I'm deciding to release it. 

As more people end up using this mod, that's when this mod can really grow. 

I'd say the target users are the mad man's that are obssessed with optimizing their megabases or the ones that are building entire cpus in game. Basically non casual players.

Oh yeah. The api isn't so beginner friendly. Be ready for callbacks, hooks, and scheduling. It's not super complex, but definitely not for first time coders.

I'm also open to contributors. Especially for things like art and ui (I suck at those). Feel free to contribute modules also (if they're decent quality).

Highly recommended to use a decent text editor like VS code, and then paste into the ingame gui!

Check the examples for more aswell. That's all there is for now.
